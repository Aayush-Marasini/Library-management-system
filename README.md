# 📚 Library Management System

A web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for managing library operations such as book listings, borrowing, and returns.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Home page interface
- `style.css` — Styles for the interface
- `script.js` — Frontend logic (if implemented)

## 🛠 Features

- View list of books
- Borrow and return interface (UI-based)
- Responsive frontend layout

## 🚫 Limitations

- No backend or database integration
- Data is not persistent (resets on reload)
- No authentication or user roles

## 🛠 To-Do / Ideas for Improvement

- Add PHP and MySQL for backend functionality
- Create user login system (admin, member)
- Implement book inventory and availability logic
- Track borrow/return dates
